# Contributing to FractalForge

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Razee4315/FractalForge/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Razee4315/FractalForge/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Share the exact commands you used
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `python -m black .` for style unification

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
